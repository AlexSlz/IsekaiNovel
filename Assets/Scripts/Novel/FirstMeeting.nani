Lying on the bed, I thought about only one thing...
Before I could lie down on the bed, someone ran into my room.
@char Rin.Smile
@spawn ShakeCamera
Oh!
So this is Rin, my old friend!
Rin.OpenSmile: {PlayerName}!!! 
Rin: Why are you still sleeping?
{PlayerName}: Why not?
Rin: Hmmm... Coco was just looking for you.
Rin: Maybe you should go check on her.
@showUI Quest
@set quest="Talk to Coco.";QuestId=1
{PlayerName}: I'm already moving forward!
